# FlashCards

## Abstract

FlashCards is an introductory project in Javascript to OOP and TDD programming that provides the user with a flash card game in their terminal. The idea is that from a dataset of cards a flash card game can be run in the terminal using node.js.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal. 

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal: 

```bash
Node server running on port 3000
```

When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:
